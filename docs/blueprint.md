# **App Name**: PhonoTouch

## Core Features:

- File Upload and Processing: Allows users to upload images (JPEG, PNG, GIF) or multi-page PDFs. The app processes these files to detect text and its location on the page.
- Visual Rendering: Renders uploaded pages visually identical to the original, preserving layout, fonts, colors, and images.  Dynamically generates invisible hitboxes around each detected character.
- Touch-to-Sound: Plays the corresponding phonetic sound when a user touches a letter on the displayed page, with configurable options for phoneme or letter-name playback.
- Language Support: Offers multi-language support with configurable audio sets. Fallback to a configurable text-to-speech engine for unsupported characters.
- Offline Mode: Provides basic functionality (visual display + pre-downloaded audio) without internet access.
- Settings Configuration: Allows adults to configure settings such as language, voice (male/female), playback speed, and enable accessibility options such as large hit targets and voice-over compatibility.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A soft, playful blue (#64B5F6) to evoke trust and learning.
- Background color: A very light blue (#E3F2FD), nearly white, providing a calm and clean backdrop.
- Accent color: A warm, inviting yellow (#FFD54F), slightly different from the primary hue, to highlight interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text.
- Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) for longer text.
- Use colorful, rounded icons that are intuitive for children.
- Kid-friendly layout with large, easy-to-tap buttons and minimal text. Display subtle visual feedback on touch, such as a brief highlight around the tapped character.
- Subtle, cheerful animations when transitioning between pages or interacting with letters.
